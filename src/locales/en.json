          "question": "Is it really safe?",
          "answer": "Yes, we don't touch critical OS system files. We focus only on 'caches' and 'temp files' created by dev tools. Unlike generic cleaners that might break your system."

        {
          "question": "What if I delete a necessary file by mistake?",
          "answer": "Don't worry. All files we delete are 'reproducible'. They will reappear whenever you run 'npm install' or build again. It just takes a little time."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is the scan?",

          "question": "Do you support M1, M2, M3 chips?",
